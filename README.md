# Visual memory test

"Visual Memory Test" is a web-based game designed to test and improve your visual memory. The game works by displaying a grid of cells with some of them highlighted for a brief period. Your task is to remember the highlighted cells and then click on them once they disappear. The game gets progressively more challenging as you move up the levels, with more cells to remember. The game keeps track of your lives and scores, and you can restart the game at any time to try to beat your previous high score. Enjoy testing and improving your visual memory on [Visual memory test](https://jeffkwakou.github.io/visual-memory-test/)
